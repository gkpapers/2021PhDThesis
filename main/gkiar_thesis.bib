                   Floating-Point (FP) calculations in industrial scientific
                   computing codes is an important part of the Verification,
                   Validation and Uncertainty Quantification (VVUQ) process.
                   Stochastic Arithmetic is one way to model and estimate FP
                   losses of accuracy, which scales well to large, industrial
                   codes. It exists in different flavors, such as CESTAC or
                   MCA, implemented in various tools such as CADNA, Verificarlo
                   or Verrou. These methodologies and tools are based on the
                   idea that FP losses of accuracy can be modeled via
                   randomness. Therefore, they share the same need to perform a
                   statistical analysis of programs results in order to
                   estimate the significance of the results. In this paper, we
                   propose a framework to perform a solid statistical analysis
                   of Stochastic Arithmetic. This framework unifies all
                   existing definitions of the number of significant digits
                   (CESTAC and MCA), and also proposes a new quantity of
                   interest: the number of digits contributing to the accuracy
                   of the results. Sound confidence intervals are provided for
                   all estimators, both in the case of normally distributed
                   results, and in the general case. The use of this framework
                   is demonstrated by two case studies of large, industrial
                   codes: Europlexus and code\textbackslash\_aster.",

              using regional gray matter volume, as well as to investigate
              changes in small-world and modular organization with normal
              aging. We constructed structural brain networks composed of 90
              regions in young, middle, and old age groups. We randomly
              selected 350 healthy subjects for each group from a Japanese
              magnetic resonance image database. Structural brain networks in
              three age groups showed economical small-world properties,
              providing high global and local efficiency for parallel
              information processing at low connection cost. The small-world
              efficiency and node betweenness varied significantly and revealed
              a U- or inverted U-curve model tendency among three age groups.
              Results also demonstrated that structural brain networks
              exhibited a modular organization in which the connections between
              regions are much denser within modules than between them. The
              modular organization of structural brain networks was similar
              between the young and middle age groups, but quite different from
              the old group. In particular, the old group showed a notable
              decrease in the connector ratio and the intermodule connections.
              Combining the results of small-world efficiency, node betweenness
              and modular organization, we concluded that the brain network
              changed slightly, developing into a more distributed organization
              from young to middle age. The organization eventually altered
              greatly, shifting to a more localized organization in old age.
              Our findings provided quantitative insights into topological
              principles of structural brain networks and changes related to
              normal aging.",

              health problems including diabetes, hypertension, and stroke.
              These cardiovascular afflictions increase risk for cognitive
              decline and dementia, but it is unknown whether these factors,
              specifically obesity and Type II diabetes, are associated with
              specific patterns of brain atrophy. We used tensor-based
              morphometry (TBM) to examine gray matter (GM) and white matter
              (WM) volume differences in 94 elderly subjects who remained
              cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their scan.
              Bivariate analyses with corrections for multiple comparisons
              strongly linked body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma insulin
              (FPI) levels, and Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) with atrophy in
              frontal, temporal, and subcortical brain regions. A multiple
              regression model, also correcting for multiple comparisons,
              revealed that BMI was still negatively correlated with brain
              atrophy (FDR 30) showed atrophy in the frontal lobes, anterior
              cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus compared with
              individuals with a normal BMI (18.5-25). Overweight subjects
              (BMI: 25-30) had atrophy in the basal ganglia and corona radiata
              of the WM. Overall brain volume did not differ between overweight
              and obese persons. Higher BMI was associated with lower brain
              volumes in overweight and obese elderly subjects. Obesity is
              therefore associated with detectable brain volume deficits in
              cognitively normal elderly subjects.",

  abstract = "Magnetic resonance imaging has become an indispensable tool for
              studying associations of structural and functional properties of
              the brain with behavior in humans. However, generally recognized
              standards for assessing and reporting the reliability of these
              techniques are still lacking. Here, we introduce a new approach
              for assessing and reporting reliability, termed intra-class
              effect decomposition (ICED). ICED uses structural equation
              modeling of data from a repeated-measures design to decompose
              reliability into orthogonal sources of measurement error that are
              associated with different characteristics of the measurements,
              for example, session, day, or scanning site. This allows
              researchers to describe the magnitude of different error
              components, make inferences about error sources, and inform them
              in planning future studies. We apply ICED to published
              measurements of myelin content and resting state functional
              connectivity. These examples illustrate how longitudinal data can
              be leveraged separately or conjointly with cross-sectional data
              to obtain more precise estimates of reliability.",

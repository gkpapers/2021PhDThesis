  abstract = "All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to
              communicate their results with reference to anatomical regions.
              In particular, comparative morphometry and group analysis of
              functional and physiological data require coregistration of
              brains to establish correspondences across brain structures. It
              is well established that linear registration of one brain to
              another is inadequate for aligning brain structures, so numerous
              algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains to one
              another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear
              deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever
              conducted. Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world
              are evaluated using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000
              registrations between 80 manually labeled brains were performed
              by algorithms including: AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons,
              FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO, SICLE, SyN, and four different
              SPM5 algorithms (``SPM2-type'' and regular Normalization, Unified
              Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All of these registrations
              were preceded by linear registration between the same image pairs
              using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings of this study
              is that the relative performances of the registration methods
              under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice of
              subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap
              measure. This is important because it suggests that the findings
              are generalizable to new subject populations that are labeled or
              evaluated using different labeling protocols. Furthermore, we
              ranked the 14 methods according to three completely independent
              analyses (permutation tests, one-way ANOVA tests, and
              indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost identical top
              rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's DARTEL Toolbox
              gave the best results according to overlap and distance measures,
              with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high accuracy
              across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published on the
              http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.",

  author   = "Skare, S and Hedehus, M and Moseley, M E and Li, T Q",
  abstract = "Diffusion tensor mapping with MRI can noninvasively track neural
              connectivity and has great potential for neural scientific
              research and clinical applications. For each diffusion tensor
              imaging (DTI) data acquisition scheme, the diffusion tensor is
              related to the measured apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) by
              a transformation matrix. With theoretical analysis we demonstrate
              that the noise performance of a DTI scheme is dependent on the
              condition number of the transformation matrix. To test the
              theoretical framework, we compared the noise performances of
              different DTI schemes using Monte-Carlo computer simulations and
              experimental DTI measurements. Both the simulation and the
              experimental results confirmed that the noise performances of
              different DTI schemes are significantly correlated with the
              condition number of the associated transformation matrices. We
              therefore applied numerical algorithms to optimize a DTI scheme
              by minimizing the condition number, hence improving the
              robustness to experimental noise. In the determination of
              anisotropic diffusion tensors with different orientations, MRI
              data acquisitions using a single optimum b value based on the
              mean diffusivity can produce ADC maps with regional differences
              in noise level. This will give rise to rotational variances of
              eigenvalues and anisotropy when diffusion tensor mapping is
              performed using a DTI scheme with a limited number of
              diffusion-weighting gradient directions. To reduce this type of
              artifact, a DTI scheme with not only a small condition number but
              also a large number of evenly distributed diffusion-weighting
              gradients in 3D is preferable.",

              software project for the analysis of data from diffusion magnetic
              resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments. dMRI is an application of
              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for
              tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are
              provided to calculate various statistics, informative
              visualizations, as well as file-handling routines to assist in
              the development and use of novel techniques. In contrast to many
              other scientific software projects, Dipy is not being developed
              by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project that
              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of
              contributors, spanning seven different academic institutions in
              five countries and three continents, which is still growing.",

              risk and resilience across the lifespan. To attain these
              objectives, sufficiently powered datasets with broad and deep
              phenotypic characterization, state-of-the-art neuroimaging, and
              genetic samples must be generated and made openly available to
              the scientific community. The enhanced Nathan Kline
              Institute-Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is a response to this need.
              NKI-RS is an ongoing, institutionally centered endeavor aimed at
              creating a large-scale (N > 1000), deeply phenotyped,
              community-ascertained, lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years old) with
              advanced neuroimaging and genetics. These data will be publically
              shared, openly, and prospectively (i.e., on a weekly basis).
              Herein, we describe the conceptual basis of the NKI-RS, including
              study design, sampling considerations, and steps to synchronize
              phenotypic and neuroimaging assessment. Additionally, we describe

              while protecting participant confidentiality, maintaining an
              adequate database, and certifying data integrity. The pilot phase
              of the NKI-RS, including challenges in recruiting,
              characterizing, imaging, and sharing data, is discussed while
              also explaining how this experience informed the final design of
              the enhanced NKI-RS. It is our hope that familiarity with the

              harmonization with future data collection efforts aimed at
              advancing psychiatric neuroscience and nosology.",

              tissue classification, their accumulation creates important

              developments and current status of FSL. We also include some
              descriptions of parts of FSL that are not well covered in the
              existing literature. We hope that some of this content might be
              of interest to users of FSL, and also maybe to new research
              groups considering creating, releasing and supporting new
              software packages for brain image analysis.",
